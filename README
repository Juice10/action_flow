ActionFlow
==========

A simple Rails plugin for specifying sequences of actions. Useful for wizards
and other multi-step form processes, allowing you to easily compose and splice
sequences together.

The plugin decides where the app needs to direct to next by watching requests
made during a session and matching them against your pre-defined flows.


Example
=======

Say you want to direct users to the dashboard after they've signed up. In
your environment.rb:

  ActionFlow.configure do
    flow :signup, users.new, post(users.create), application.dashboard
  end

This specifies a flow called "signup" that consists of the following series
of requests:
  
  * UsersController#new
  * POST UsersController#create
  * ApplicationController#dashboard

When the user hits UsersController#new, we know they're in the "signup" flow.
The user remains in that flow until they complete it, or until they make a
request that does not continue the current sequence AND begins another sequence.
(This allows for intervenening requests such as Ajax calls not to kick the
user out of their current flow.)

In your controller, you can use next_in_flow to redirect to another action
based on the flow the user is currently in:

  class UsersController < ApplicationController
    def create
      @user = User.create(params[:user])
      next_in_flow if @user.save
    end
  end
